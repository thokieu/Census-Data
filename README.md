# Census-Data
Job patterns of women and minorities in private industry.

This project is used to demonstrate my skillset in interpreting and cleaning raw real world data. The files attach show an aggregate list of all industries within all states plus the District of Columbia and the count of people working within each industry broken down by race, gender, and title. I cleaned and used variable headings from a "data dictionary" supplied by the census website to link and extract revelant data for later counting starting from 2009 to 2018.

See Workbook.ipynb to view work originally created in Jupyter Notebook.
Due to the massive size of the returned dataframes and Git Hub's 100 mb limit, the workbook does not show the results, so to see the count data copy the repository and run them locally. 
(note: Github frequently fails to load the file the first time, so try a reload if it doesn't work)
